# Project #1: 

Simplified space invaders in JS

This is a 1 level space invaders game 

After doing research on how to best layout the functions, I used a grid method to cycle through the invaders and track whether or not they run into our space ship. 

There is a win state and a lose state

win state is when all of the invaders are destroyed before reaching the bottom of the grid 

lose state is when the player collides with aliens and/or the aliens reach the bottom of the grid

I learned how to add graphics and sounds to accent events, in addition to key functions, switch cases and classlist.includes.

Needs improvement:

Make laser time out 
Add levels that push new invaders into grid and/or speed up game
Increase grid size 
Make sure latest version is being deployed with github pages 
Sound effects do not work on github pages
