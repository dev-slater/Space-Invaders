# Project #1: 

Simplified space invaders in JS

This is a 1 level space invaders game 

After doing research on how to best layout the functions, I used a grid method to cycle through the invaders and track whether or not they run into our space ship. 

the controls are very simple, press play and begin to move with the right and left arrow keys, shoot with space key 

There is a win state and a lose state

win state is when all of the invaders are destroyed before reaching the bottom of the grid 

lose state is when the player collides with aliens and/or the aliens reach the bottom of the grid

I learned how to add graphics and sounds to accent events, in addition to key functions, switch cases and classlist.includes.

Needs improvement:

Make laser time out, this error bugs me 
Add levels that push new invaders into grid and/or speed up game
Increase grid size, next step is to multiply by 3x
Make sure latest version is being deployed with github pages 
Sound effects do not work on github pages, source files locally?
